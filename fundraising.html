          <p>
            GSP Rescue (SW) have now registered with Easy Fund Raising to raise
            money for our organisation.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope you will use this free service when you shop online.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once registered, everytime you buy from a site registered with Easy
            Fund Raising, a donation will be made to our rescue - and it costs
            you nothing!
          </p>

          <p>
            All you need to do is register at
            <a href="http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk">EasyFundraising</a>
            (which only takes a minute and is free). In the first box 'Charity /
            Organisation' type in GSP and then search - then select GSP Rescue
            (SW).
          </p>

          <p>
            Then each time you want to buy something on-line, login to
            Easyfundraising first, and then use the links to go to your chosen
            retailer.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is a wide range of retailers registered with the scheme (with
            more being added daily). These include big sites like Amazon;
            M&amp;S; Comet; etc. to more specialist sites like the dog insurance
            specialists PetPlan etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some retailers will donate a percentage of your order value to the
            rescue (like M&S), and others will donate a set sum. The level of
            donation any retailer offers is listed on the site.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over 2000 retailers are listed, and you pay the same prices exactly
            as if you visited each retailers website directly.
          </p>

          <p>
            A good way to remember to use the site is to make it your Home.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will update our website to show the amount raised by this
            initiative at the end of each year.
          </p>

          <p>
            It costs you nothing apart from a little thought - so why not make a
            difference today and register as above.
          </p>

          <p class="thankyou">
            Thank you for your support.
