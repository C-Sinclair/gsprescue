            You may now use PayPal to make an ad-hoc or regular donation to GSP
            Rescue(SW).
          </p>
          <p>
            You may use this option to make an adoption donation; an ad-hoc
            donation; a donation in response to a particular fund-raising
            request; or to enter competitions and purchase items (when offered)
            from us.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, please ensure that you include your name and the reason for
            your donation in the text box provided. N.B. The option to complete
            the message box appears on the second PayPal page on the left-hand
            side underneath the payment detail line.
          </p>
          <p>
            P.S. If you already have a PayPal account, then you can make a
            payment directly from your existing account to
            <a href="#" onclick="donateClick">donate@gsprescuesw.co.uk</a>. By
            paying this way, GSP Rescue (SW) will not be charged any transaction
            fees, thereby making your donation even more useful to us in helping
            needy GSPs. As above, please do include a note giving the reason for
            your donation.
