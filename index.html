				<p>This is the web site for German Short-Haired Pointer Rescue (SW),  a donation reliant organisation that rehomes German Shorthaired Pointers throughout the UK</p>
				<p>It was originally set up in the late 1990â€™s and run by David Bishop until his unexpected death at the end of 2008.</p>
				<p>The organisation is currently run by  Sarah Hadley with valuable assistance from others.</p>
				<p>To date we have safely rehomed &gt; 600 dogs.</p>
 
				<p>Over the past few years the rescue has expanded not only to assist dogs from any part of the UK, but also (often in conjunction with other rescues). to assist in rehoming  dogs from Ireland, and sometimes even further afield like Spain, Cyprus and Greece.</p>
				<p>In the meantime, it you would like to find details of the dogs we have for rehoming, please visit our forum pages:-</p>
