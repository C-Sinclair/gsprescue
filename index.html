            This is the web site for German Short-Haired Pointer Rescue (SW), a
            donation reliant organisation that rehomes German Shorthaired
            Pointers throughout the UK
          </p>
          <p>
            It was originally set up in the late 1990’s and run by David Bishop
            until his unexpected death at the end of 2008.
          </p>
          <p>
            The organisation is currently run by Sarah Hadley with valuable
            assistance from others.
          </p>
          <p>To date we have safely rehomed &gt; 700 dogs.</p>
          <p>
            In more recent times, the rescue has reduced it’s operations, and
            now mainly helps dogs from Spain in conjunction with a small
            Spanish-based rescue, whilst continuing to offer ongoing support to
            any dog rehomed by us.
          </p>
          <p>
